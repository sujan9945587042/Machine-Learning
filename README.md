üìä Machine Learning Hands-On Projects

This repository contains my hands-on projects where I applied different Machine Learning algorithms on real-world datasets. Each project demonstrates how the algorithm works, its strengths, and practical applications.

üîπ Projects Included
1Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression ‚Äì Bank Loan Approval System

Built a Bank Loan Approval Model using Logistic Regression.

Applied feature preprocessing & trained the model to classify loan approvals.

üìà Focused on understanding classification problems and decision boundaries.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Tree ‚Äì Heart Disease Prediction

Dataset: heart.csv

Implemented Decision Tree Classifier with max_depth tuning.

Learned how tree depth impacts bias vs variance and model interpretability.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest ‚Äì Census Income Dataset

Dataset: Census Income Data

Compared Decision Tree vs Random Forest performance.

Applied GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Observed Random Forest‚Äôs ability to reduce overfitting.

4Ô∏è‚É£ K-Means Clustering ‚Äì Customer Segmentation

Used WCSS (Elbow Method) to find the optimal k.

Visualized scatter plots with centroids.

Learned how KMeans is used in segmentation problems.

5Ô∏è‚É£ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ‚Äì Classification

Implemented KNN Classifier for classification tasks.

Understood how distance metrics & K-value affect performance.

Great for learning about instance-based learning.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Naive Bayes ‚Äì Email Spam Classification

Dataset: Spam/Not Spam emails

Applied CountVectorizer for text preprocessing.

Used MultinomialNB for classification.

Built a simple Spam Filter using probabilistic ML.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ‚Äì NBA Dataset

Dataset: NBA dataset with 44 features.

Without PCA: Logistic Regression gave 80% accuracy.

After PCA (dimensionality reduction): Accuracy improved to 86%.

Learned how PCA helps in feature reduction & performance boost.

8 Support Vector Machine (SVM) ‚Äì Drug Classification
- Dataset: **drug.csv**.  
- Predicted drug type using patient data (Age, Sex, BP, Cholesterol).  
- Tested different **kernels** (`linear`, `rbf`, `poly`).  
- SVM handled non-linear separations effectively.
